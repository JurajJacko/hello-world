# hello-world
This is a starter experiment.

I need to learn how to use GitHub for an R project. 
I also need to learn how I can create a web site that will host my interactive graphics. 

Learning from official GitHub tutorial now, on larger scale following Jenny Bryan's book, and on the still larger, Hadley Wickham's R for data science.
